# Microverse Project Title - Responsive Design and CSS frameworks [Solo Project]
Using Bootstrap Project.

## Introduction.
This project requests students to build a replica of the news site Newsweek.com using the Bootstrap framework.

You can find the original project specification at: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/using-bootstrap

## Project specific
1. Remember to use Bootstrap CSS classes wherever it is possible - this is the main point of this project.

2. As you can use a ready set of CSS classes, be more precise and make sure that you page looks exactly the same as the source page.

3. Remember to double-check if you page layout does not break on smaller screens.

## Steps
1. Visit [Newsweek](http://www.newsweek.com/) and have a look around.

2. Follow the instructions atop the [Google Homepage project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) to set up a Github repository for this project (of course youâ€™ll need to change the title).

3. Create a new HTML document.

4. Think about all the elements on the page and how they are grouped together.

5. Add Bootstrap to your project by following the instructions at [GetBootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/). Use the examples on that page as templates for how to organize your page.

6. Lay out the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and which are positioned by using the appropriate Bootstrap classes.

7. Set up the top title and navigation bar.

8. Work your way down the page by filling in and positioning the additional sections.

9. Try resizing the browser to see if it mimics the behavior of the real Newsweek homepage.

10. Push your solution to Github.
